The negative spearman coefficient number shows that the search engine Duck Duck Go performed differently than Google. The largest overlap between the two search engines, which is only possible in one scenario and in a different sequence, indicates that the two search engines produced different results. This demonstrates how the search engines prioritize the search results using various criteria. The average rho (Average Spearman Coefficient) is -9.74, suggesting that two outcomes are ranked differently from one another. Additionally, the fact that the number is negative denotes that there is either no association or a bad association between them. There is only a 2.1 average overlap, or 21.0% average overlap.
